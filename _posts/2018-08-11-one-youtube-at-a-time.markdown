# One-at-a-time Youtube video playback

Youtube's web-ui is a little janky IMO compared to the mobile app when
it comes to making playlists on-the-fly. The best way I've found is to
open things in multiple tabs, but there's a problem to this - if you
fuck up the tabs, then you'll get more than one thing playing at once.

The project is to make a plugin for chrome/firefox/both that only lets
one youtube tab at a time play. I don't know if this is possible at
all actually, but it would be super helpful.

Alternatively, some sort of playlist builder app for youtube (or
others too!) links would be awesome.
