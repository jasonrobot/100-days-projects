# RPN Calculator

```
Reverse Polish notation (RPN), also known as Polish postfix notation
or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which
operators follow their operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN),
in which operators precede their operands.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Hewlett-Packard used RPN in all of their
desktop and hand-held calculators.[7][8] In computer science, reverse
Polish notation is used in stack-oriented programming languages such
as Forth and PostScript.

So I really like RPN. It's just kinda an easy way to think about math
on the fly. There's a sweet HP-48 emulator for Android that I used _so
much_ in college that I still input things wrong into calculators.

Not only would this be a pretty sweet command line tool to have handy,
but it would also be a pretty simple project to implement in just
about any language. It's also got some good CS-concepts, because its
all stack operations.
